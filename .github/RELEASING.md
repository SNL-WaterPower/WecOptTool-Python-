# Releasing New WecOptTool Version
This section is for developers.

Before a release make sure to:

* update the CHANGES.md (add new version number, release date and list of changes)
* change [version number](https://semver.org/) in `setup.cfg`

## GitHub
In the GitHub repository, under *Releases*, click on *Create new release*.

* Title the release with the [version number](https://semver.org/) preceded by a `v`, e.g., `v1.0.0`. Nothing else should go in the title.
* Tag the release using the same name as the *Title*.
* In the description, copy the corresponding section of the [changes file](https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/blob/main/CHANGES.md).
* Select the *Create a discussion* checkmark.

This will trigger the PyPI build and deploy.

### Pre-releases:
For pre-releases make sure to use correct [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the version number in `setup.cfg`.
In the Github release, for the *tag* name append the pre-release version after the version name, e.g., `v1.2.0-alpha` or `v1.2.1-beta.3`, and select the *pre-release* checkmark.
