    "# Tutorial 4 - Pioneer\n",
    "This tutorial models a potential design for a WEC used to provide power to instruments in the [Pioneer Central Surface Mooring System](https://oceanobservatories.org/site/cp01cnsm/) within the [Coastal Pioneer Array](https://oceanobservatories.org/array/coastal-pioneer-array/) off the coast of New England. This system has instrumentation to measure various meteorological, surface, near-surface, and seabed phenomena on the Continental Shelf-Slope and transmit back to shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous tutorials, this tutorial does not include an outer optimization loop. Instead, the focus here is on effectively modeling an optimization problem for the control of a unique WEC archetype with a pitch resonator PTO with several co-dependent components. This is completely setup in Part 1, and includes:\n",

    "* Expanding the control state vector\n",
    "* Custom PTO physics\n",
    "* Modeling non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into three parts. The first sets up the problem including the points above. The second and third show results using a regular and irregular wave, respectively.\n",

    "We will consider two waves: a regular wave and an irregular wave, both with typical characteristics of the deployment site. The regular wave is roughly at 0.35 Hz, the known pitch resonance frequency of the buoy. The irregular wave has a peak period of 5 seconds, matching that of the deployment site."
