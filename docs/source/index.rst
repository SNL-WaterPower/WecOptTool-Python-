WecOptTool Documentation
========================
The WEC Design Optimization Toolbox (WecOptTool) allows users to perform wave energy converter (WEC) device design optimization studies while including different control strategies.
In particular, this tool's key feature is the usage of a pseudo spectral solution method capable of dealing with both constraints and nonlinear dynamics.
This allows for the optimization study to find the best possible power capture performance within the system constraints (e.g., maximum power take-off force).

WecOptTool is developed by `Sandia National Laboratories`_.
The developers would also like to acknowledge benefit from past collaborations with `Data Only Greater`_ and the `Oregon State University Design Engineering Lab`_.

Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-mission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525. 

.. note::
    A MATLAB version of WecOptTool was previously released and, while no longer being developed, is still available on GitHub: `WecOptTool-MATLAB`_.
